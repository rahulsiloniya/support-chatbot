0 1ANSWEREDWhy are my audiences different sizes on different pages?Lytics regularly caches the sizes of audiences to increase the responsiveness of the interface. If you have recently edited a segment, or have just sent large amount of event data, the dashboard and summary pages may have an out-of-date audience size. To see the most accurate audience size, view the audience and click the pencil icon to edit.
