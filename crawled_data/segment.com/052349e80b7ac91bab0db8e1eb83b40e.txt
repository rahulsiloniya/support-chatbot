Coupon FAQ
Segment currently offers coupons on an ongoing basis for:
Early-stage startups
Participants and alumni of our Accelerator partners
Non-profits
Early-stage startups
Segment offers a Startup Program to enable early startups to track data correctly and easily test the marketing and analytics tools necessary to grow their business. Participating startups receive $25,000 in annual credit toward our monthly Team plan for as long as they meet our eligibility requirements (up to 2 years).
Learn more about the Segment Startup Program and eligibility requirements here.
Participants and Alumni of Accelerator Partners
We currently partner with various accelerator programs around the globe to offer promotions for both current and alumni participants. Contact your accelerator administrator to see if they partner with Segment and for more information on how to redeem the coupon.
If your accelerator does not participate in our program, have them apply here or contact us to us with the details of your program and the best point of contact for consideration.
Non-profits
We offer non-profit customers a $120 per month discount on our monthly Team plan, which typically covers 10,000 MTUs per month. Contact us to our support team with proof of your non-profit status for more details.
Special Promotions
We occasionally offer special promotions. Customers will be notified directly if they are eligible for a special promotion.
Coupon FAQ
How do coupons work?
Coupons are applied to your monthly (or annual) bill, which reduces the corresponding charge to your credit card. Coupons can either take the format of a percent-off or a dollar value-off your bill. If your coupon is a percentage-off your bill, the dollar value of the coupon may change as your bill may fluctuate month-to-month.
How do I redeem a coupon?
Eligible startups can apply directly for the Segment Startup Program. Other coupons can be redeemed by reaching out to Segment’s support team, who will apply the promotion to your account.
Where can I view which coupons are applied to my account?
The Startup Program credits are reflected in the Workspace usage and billing page. Other coupons applied to your workspace are not currently reflected in the Segment application. If you are curious about a promotion you are currently on, or if you workspace has a coupon applied, contact the Segment support team.
Do I have to be a “new” customer to receive a coupon?
The Segment Startup Program is only for customers that have not previously received any other coupon. Both the non-profit and accelerator promotion can be redeemed regardless if you’re a new customer or have been with us for years. A user/workspace can only receive any coupon once.
What happens when my coupon expires?
When your promotion expires, your bill returns to the normal, non-discounted rate. Certain promotions may include a follow-up discount immediately after the promotion expires.
