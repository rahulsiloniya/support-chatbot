Understanding business goals and use cases
Selecting your use case
Optimize advertising
Personalize first conversion
Boost retention, upsell, and cross-sell
Personalize communications and product experiences
Next steps
Segment built Use Cases to streamline the process of implementing Segment for specific business objectives.
This guide will help you navigate through the available use cases and select the one that best aligns with your business goals.
You can onboard to Segment with a Use Case if you’re a new Business Tier customer or haven’t yet connected a source and destination.
Understanding business goals and use cases
Segment supports 25 use cases, organized into 4 main business goals:
Optimize advertising
Personalize first conversion
Boost retention, upsell, and cross-sell
Personalize communications and product experiences
These goals represent key ways businesses often use customer data for improved performance and growth.
Looking for a technical breakdown of each use case? View the Use Cases Reference.
Selecting your use case
Follow these steps to identify which use case to implement:
Identify your primary business challenge or goal from the four business goals.
Review the use cases associated with that goal, considering how each aligns with your specific needs.
Evaluate your current data collection capabilities and the resources you have available.
Consider your long-term business strategy and how different use cases might support your future goals.
If you’re unsure, start with a use case that addresses your most pressing current need.
The use case you select will guide your Segment setup, including the events you’ll track and the integrations you’ll implement. However, Segment’s flexibility allows you to adapt and expand your strategy over time as your business needs evolve.
The following sections explore each business goal and associated use cases in detail.
