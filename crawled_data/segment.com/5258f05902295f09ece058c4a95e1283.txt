Create an engaging and consistent brand experience
Compelling and engaging brands delight their customers at every interaction. As customers move seamlessly across channels—such as email, push notifications, display ads—brands must similarly meet them with tailored and consistent messages.
With Segment, you can craft a tailored message while using a combination of AdRoll, Customer.IO, and other tools to dynamically switch between channels.
Talk to a product specialist today about using data to tailor your brand experience.
Tools used
Retargeting with AdRoll: AdRoll is a retargeting and prospecting tool that allows you to show display ads to a behaviorally-defined cohort
Push notifications with Braze: Braze is a multi-channel marketing campaign focused on the mobile experience
Emails with Customer.io: Customer.io is a flexible email provider that allows you to create cohorts based on customer actions. You can build complex onboarding emails, nurture email campaigns, as well as marketing automation workflows.
There are other email tools on Segment’s platform, such as Bronto, SendGrid, and Mailchimp. Check out the full list of email tools.
It’s important to register for these tools and enable them on your Segment source project. When Segment collects tracking data, it’ll also route it to all of your enabled tools. Then your tools, especially ones like Customer.io, Braze, and AdRoll, where you can define cohorts of your users, will be working off a dynamic, yet consistent data set. This is paramount in getting the dynamic messaging to update accordingly.
Set it up
When you send tracking data from your app or website to Segment, Segment will send the same data to all of your tools. Segment also collects key messaging events like Push Notification Opened and Email Opened from Braze and Customer.io, respectively, and sends that to other tools. By defining cohorts based on these events, you can create dynamic campaign audiences, to which customers can add and remove themselves.
In each of your destinations—Braze, Facebook, Customer.io, AdRoll—you can create custom campaigns to show display ads or send emails to a specific segment of users who have performed (or not performed) a given action, or “event.” In this cross-channel re-engagement example, we’ll start with push notifications.
1st line of defense: the push notification
In Braze, create a segment of customers who added a product to their cart, but did not check out. The segment definition, in this case, should be people who have performed Product Added, but have not performed Order Completed . Send a push notification to these customers with a message that the cart was abandoned and that they can complete the transaction with, for example, a 10% coupon.
2nd line of defense: the email reminder
Because Segment automatically collects second-party data from Braze, you now also have push notification event data, like Push Notification Opened and Push Notification Received in Segment. You can use the properties on each of these events to define a property called campaign_name so you can tie these activities to a given campaign.
This is helpful because now, you can define segments in Customer.io for customers who have triggered Push Notification Received, but not Push Notification Opened . You’ve now automated the process of targeting customers who don’t open your push notifications. In Customer.io, you can create a campaign that sends an email to those people asking them to check their push notifications and offering them a coupon to complete their order.
3rd line of defense: paid advertising
Since Segment collects email event data, like Email Opened, from Customer.io, you can similarly create segments in Facebook Ads and AdRoll for when customers don’t open your email. Create a segment where users have an Email Delivered event, but no Email Opened event. When users meet these criteria, they’ll get automatically added to your retargeting campaigns. You can then serve them custom creatives about them neglecting to open your emails and, again, perhaps offer them a coupon to complete the transaction.
When users do not open an activation email, add them to a specific retargeting campaign that contains messaging to remind them to activate.
With Segment, automate not just switching across channels, but also the messaging in each channel so that the entire experience is cohesive. The added benefit is that we can create specifically targeted retargeting campaigns for people who no longer open our emails or push notifications. Automating these processes with Segment makes channel-switching more seamless for your customers.
Create an engaging and consistent brand experience
This is just a simple cart abandonment example that dynamically follows customers as they switch between channels. Because Segment collects and routes the second party data of emails and push notifications being opened, you can create specific campaigns with messaging that targets your customers as they interact with your brand.
With over 200+ different tools on Segment’s platform, you can take this idea and create other tailored shopping experiences to re-engage your customers.
