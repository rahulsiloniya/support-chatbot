Request API Version 3Use the Data Subject Request API version 3 (v3) to receive and manage data subject requests (DSRs) for GDPR and CCPA compliance, and to forward data subject requests of type erasure. To learn more, see Data Subject Requests Guide.
This API is our instance of the OpenDSR framework, formerly known as OpenGDPR.
See the Default Service Limits for information about API rate limits.
Changes in v3
v3 contains the following changes:
The subject_identities are sent as a dictionary where the keys are identity types which enforces a single identity per identity type.
Additional identities can be provided in the opendsr.mparticle.com extensions.
The MPIDs and identities collections were merged into a single subject_identities dictionary with the same format as the subject_identities in the request.
If an identity of mpid is included in the extensions, no other identities can be provided in the request.
Updated the version field default to 3.0
Updated API endpoints for v3 (below)
This update enforces identity resolution to map to a single mpid, and enables forwarding of DSR requests of type erasure.
You must upgrade to version 3 in order to forward DSR requests of type erasure.
Upgrade Guide
Follow the steps below to upgrade from version 1 or version 2 to version 3.
Update to the v3 base URL https://opendsr.mparticle.com/v3.
Update the api_version to 3.0.
Update the format in the subject_identities element as described below.
Change the format of the opendsr.mparticle.com extensions as described below.
If you include mpid in the opendsr.mparticle.com extensions, you must not include any other identities.
Endpoint
The current (v3) mParticle OpenDSR base URL:
https://opendsr.mparticle.com/v3
Authentication
The HTTP APIs are secured via basic authentication. Credentials are issued at the level of an mParticle Workspace. You can obtain credentials for your Workspace from the Workspace Settings screen. Note that this authentication is for a single workspace and scopes the DSR to this workspace only.
To workspace view credentials:
Click on the current workspace name in the upper left corner.
Click Settings.
Click on the name of a workspace to display the Edit Workspace settings page.
You can authenticate in two ways:
Many HTTP clients support basic authentication. Use your API key for the username and your API secret for the password.
Manually set the authentication header by encoding your key and secret together:
Concatenate your application key and secret together with a colon (:) separating the two:
example-api-key:example-api-secret
2 Base64 with UTF-8 encode the result:
ZXhhbXBsZS1hcGkta2V5OmV4YW1wbGUtYXBpLXNlY3JldA==
3 Prefix the encoded string with the authorization method, including a space:
Basic ZXhhbXBsZS1hcGkta2V5OmV4YW1wbGUtYXBpLXNlY3JldA==
4 Set resulting string as the Authorization header in your HTTP requests:
Authorization: Basic ZXhhbXBsZS1hcGkta2V5OmV4YW1wbGUtYXBpLXNlY3JldA==
Resources
The primary resource is the request object:

Submit a Data Subject Request (DSR)
A request in the OpenDSR format communicates a Data Subject’s wish to access or erase their data. The OpenDSR Request takes a JSON request body and requires a Content-Type: application/json header:
POST https://opendsr.mparticle.com/v3/requests/
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Basic <your-token-here>

The group_id can be used to relate different subject requests together. The maximum number of requests that can be associated to a group_id is 150. Groups are scoped to the workspace.
extensions
array
Optional
Contains processor-specific extensions. For mParticle, use the extensions opendsr.mparticle.com. See below for supported identity types.
The subject_identities Object
The subject_identities are sent as a dictionary where the keys are identity types, and the value fields are value and encoding. You can specify up to 50 identities in a single request. The number of identities in a request is also limited by the number of different unique identity types.
"identity_type": {
"value": "some value",
"encoding": "raw"
}
Field Name
Data Type
Description
identity_type
string
The type of identity
value
string
The identity value
encoding
string
The encoding format of the identity value. For mParticle, the value is raw.
Supported Identity Types
Data subject requests using the OpenDSR format may include an object called subject_identities. If you use this object, you must specify:
identity_type: A string representing the type of identifier used (such as email or android_advertising_id)
value: A string representing the value of the identifier (such as example@example.com)
encoding: a string representing how the identifier is encoded
While the OpenDSR framework accepts raw, sha1, md5, and sha256 as values for the identity_format, mParticle only supports sending IDs with the raw identity format.
When setting the identity_type in the subject_identities object of an OpenDSR request, make sure to use values from the column labeled Supported OpenDSR Format in the table below. The column labeled mParticle Identity Type indicates the corresponding types used in mParticle.

Callbacks
When a request changes status, including when a request is first created, mParticle sends a callback POST to all URLs specified in the status_callback_urls array of the request. Callbacks are queued and sent every 15 minutes.
Callback requests are signed and issued over TLS. You must validate the authenticity of the request before parsing the request body.
Validating a Callback Request
Establish a whitelist of all processor domains that you will allow to issue callbacks.
If the X-OpenDSR-Processor-Domain header value is in your whitelist, fetch the certificate. The certificate URL is available as the value of "processor_certificate" in the /discovery response body. The certificate can be cached for the lifetime of the certificate.
Validate the certificate. This should be handled by a library. Certificate validation should confirm that:
The certificate was issued by a trusted authority.
The certificate was issued to the exact string given in the X-OpenDSR-Processor-Domain header value.
The certificate has not expired.
If the certificate is valid, use it to validate the X-OpenDSR-Signature header against the raw request body. mParticle uses SHA256 RSA as a signing algorithm.
Return a response with a 202 Accepted status header if all validations are successful. Return a response with a 401 Unauthorized status header if the signature fails to validate or the processor domain is not in your whitelist.
